        <h2>Heurisitics</h2>
        <p>Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics are a set of principles outlined by Jakob Nielsen, a renowned usability consultant, to evaluate the usability of user interfaces. These heuristics serve as guidelines for designing user-friendly interfaces and improving the overall user experience. When building websites, adherence to these heuristics can significantly enhance usability and ultimately lead to higher user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
		<h3>Overview of the 10 Heurisitics:</h3>

		<ol>
    <li class="bold-heading"><h4>Visibility of system status:</h4> Make sure users always know what's happening on the website. For example, when someone clicks a button, the website should show them something is happening, like a spinning wheel, to let them know their action is working.</li>
</ol>

			<li><p class="bold-heading">Visibility of system status: </p>Make sure users always know what's happening on the website. For example, when someone clicks a button, the website should show them something is happening, like a spinning wheel, to let them know their action is working.</li>

		<li><h4>Match between system and the real world: </h4>Use words and ideas that people understand easily. For instance, if you're building a website about animals, use pictures and words that show real animals and their habitats, like forests or oceans.</li>

		<li>User control and freedom: Let users easily move around the website and fix any mistakes they make. For instance, if someone clicks on the wrong page, make sure there's a button they can click to go back to where they were before.</li>

		<li>Consistency and standards: Keep things the same across the website so users know what to expect. For example, if you use a blue button for one thing, keep using blue buttons for similar things on other pages.</li>

		<li>Error prevention: Try to stop mistakes before they happen. For example, if someone forgets to fill in their name on a form, show a message reminding them to do it before they can move on.</li>

		<li>Recognition rather than recall: Make it easy for users to find what they need without having to remember things. For example, instead of expecting users to remember a web address, put a search bar where they can type what they're looking for.</li>

		<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use: Design the website so everyone, whether they're new or already know a lot, can use it easily. For example, add shortcuts or quick links for people who know how to use the website well.</li>

		<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design: Keep the website simple and neat so it's easy to understand. For example, use only a few colors and pictures on each page, and make sure there's enough space between things so it doesn't look crowded.</li>

		<li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: If someone makes a mistake, show them what went wrong and how to fix it. For example, if someone types the wrong password, show them a message saying it's wrong and give them a way to reset it.</li>

		<li>Help and documentation: Give users easy access to help if they need it. For example, put a button or link on every page where users can click to get tips or instructions on how to use the website.</li>

			<h2>Visibility of System Status</h2>
			<p>The system should always keep users informed about what is happening, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
			<p>Users should never be left wondering about the status of their actions or the system's response.</p>
			<p>Feedback can be in the form of progress indicators, success messages, or error notifications.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic">
			<h2>Match Between System and the Real World</h2>
			<p>The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.</p>
			<p>It should follow real-world conventions and provide information in a natural and logical order.</p>
			<p>Users should feel that the system behaves in a way that matches their expectations.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic">
			<h2>User Control and Freedom</h2>
			<p>Users often make mistakes. The system should offer "undo" and "redo" functions to allow users to correct errors easily.</p>
			<p>Users should have the freedom to navigate and exit the system or a specific section without feeling trapped.</p>
			<p>Providing clear exit points and cancel buttons can help users maintain a sense of control.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic">
			<h2>Consistency and Standards</h2>
			<p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.</p>
			<p>Consistency in design, terminology, and functionality helps users build a mental model of the system more easily.</p>
			<p>Following established conventions and industry standards can enhance usability.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic">
			<h2>Error Prevention</h2>
			<p>It's better to prevent errors than to provide informative error messages after they occur.</p>
			<p>The system should anticipate and minimize the possibility of user errors through careful design and validation.</p>
			<p>Clear and concise instructions can help users avoid pitfalls.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic grid-col-span-3">
			<h2>Recognition Rather than Recall</h2>
			<p>Minimize the user's memory load. Information needed to use the system should be visible or easily retrievable.</p>
			<p>Users should not be required to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.</p>
			<p>Menus, options, and actions should be self-explanatory and readily available.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic grid-col-span-3">
			<h2>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h2>
			<p>The system should cater to both novice and expert users.</p>
			<p>Expert users should be able to perform tasks more quickly, with shortcuts and advanced features available.</p>
			<p>Efficiency enhancements should not hinder novice users or create a steeper learning curve.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic grid-col-span-2">
			<h2>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h2>
			<p>Irrelevant or rarely needed information should be minimized or made optional to reduce clutter.</p>
			<p>A visually pleasing design can enhance the user's experience and make it more enjoyable.</p>
			<p>Simple, clean interfaces often lead to better usability.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic">
			<h2>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</h2>
			<p>Error messages should be expressed in plain language, indicating what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>
			<p>Offer users clear instructions on how to recover from common errors without necessarily resorting to technical jargon.</p>
			<p>Provide options to undo actions, if possible, and guide users toward resolving issues effectively.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heuristic">
			<h2>Help and Documentation</h2>
			<p>Although it's best to design systems that are so intuitive that users don't need help, it's still important to offer accessible documentation.</p>
			<p>Provide a help system or documentation that is easy to search and navigate, with clear explanations and examples.</p>
			<p>Ensure that help resources are available at the right time and in the right context to assist users when needed.</p>
